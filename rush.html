			<div class = "blurb" id = "zach"><img class = "q-mark" src="quotation-mark.png">Looking back on my four years at Yale and the countless opportunities Yale provides, joining Living Water was the most important decision I made. I grew incredibly -- musically, personally, and spiritually.  Living Water is far more than an excellent singing group with a musically diverse repertoire; it is a tight Christian community full of supportive friends with delightfully eclectic backgrounds, and it is a community that uses performance and service to reach our campus, the country and the world with the true hope of Jesus Christ. <img class = "back-quotation-mark" src = "back-quotation-mark.png"> If you want to grow in your faith and be used tangibly by God during your time at Yale, and, of course, sing, Living Water provides the perfect environment to do so. <span id = "blurb-author">- Zachary Maher '13</span></div>

Whenever one of us is down, you really get to see God's love pour through the people surrounding you. <img class = "back-quotation-mark" src = "back-quotation-mark.png">Rehearsals are fun, the people are amazing and super friendly, and you pretty much get the best friends ever. So much love for this group! <span id="blurb-author">- Andres Valdivieso '16</span></div>
